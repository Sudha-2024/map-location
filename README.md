# map-location

- This HTML document creates a map animation using the Mapbox API.

- It displays a map with a button to show bus stops between Gandhipuram and Sulur.

- The map is initialized with a specific center and zoom level.

- A marker is added at the first bus stop's coordinates.

- The `move` function updates the marker's position every second, animating the route along predefined bus stops.

- The overlay and styles enhance user interaction.
